This is a hobby project of a non-existing florbal e-shop website. It includes basic login and register functionality (authentication was done using Google Firebase), homepage, contacts and the shop itself (for viewing shop, you have to be logged in). The shop site contains different kinds of products (site gets them from firebase database), which we can toggle using filters or order by some implemented rules. Additionally, admin user has a permission to add a new product to the shop using the + button at the end of the page. User can see details of a product by clicking on it. Of course, buying the product won't do anything, this is just a exercise web application. Admin user can delete products from the page.    

If you want to use the web application, you can create new regular users. However, I have already created two users, one is an admin user, the second one is a regular user. Their login credentials are listed here:

ADMIN:
Email: admin@gmail.com
Password: admin123

REGULAR USER:
Email: user@gmail.com
Password: 123456

There is still big room for improvement in this project and I may be adding new functionality soon...
